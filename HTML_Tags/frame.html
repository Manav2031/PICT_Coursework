        <h1>x86_86 architecture</h1>

        x86-64 (also known as x64, x86_64, AMD64, and Intel 64)[note 1] is a 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set, 
        first announced in 1999. It introduced two new modes of operation, 64-bit mode and compatibility mode, along 
        with a new 4-level paging mode.
        With 64-bit mode and the new paging mode, it supports vastly larger amounts of virtual memory and physical memory 
        than was possible on its 32-bit predecessors, allowing programs to store larger amounts of data in memory. 
        x86-64 also expands general-purpose registers to 64-bit, and expands the number of them from 8 
        (some of which had limited or fixed functionality, e.g. for stack management) to 16 (fully general), 
        and provides numerous other enhancements.
