1. Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting
the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
i. Insert new node, ii. Find number of nodes in longest path from root, iii. Minimum data
value found in the tree, iv. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers
are swapped at every node, v. Search a value

2. Beginning with an empty binary tree, Construct binary tree by inserting the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree perform following operations on it-
* Perform inorder, preorder and post order traversal
* Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node
* Find the height of tree
* Copy this tree to another `operator=`
* Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes.
* Erase all nodes in a binary tree.
(Implement both recursive and non-recursive methods)

3. Create an inordered threaded binary search tree. Perform inorder, preorder traversals without recursion and deletion of a node. Analyze time and space complexity of the algorithm.

4. Consider telephone book database of N clients. Make use of a hashtable implementation to quickly look up clientâ€™s telephone number. Make use of two collision handling techniques and compare them using number of comparisons required to find a set of telephone numbers
(Note: Use linear probing with replacement and without replacement)
