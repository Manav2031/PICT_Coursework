# üéì PICT Coursework - Shubham Panchal
> A collection of all assignments for computer engineering w.r.t. SPPU Pune

```
The objective of building this repository is to help my batchmates
with college assignments. Refer these assignments only to understand the flow/structure of
the solution, and not for the sake of completion or submissions, as it would not polish your programming skills.
If you feel a particular piece of code can be improved, do [open an issue] or [start a discussion] here.
You may also consider opening a pull request.
Best of luck üëç
